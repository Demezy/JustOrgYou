# SwipeApp

Project to quickly sort data via swipes!
Very easy and aimed for mobile. Very good for GTD like systems. Or any other
task management approach.

## Getting Started

### Building using docker

Welcome to PR here. I am going to add it someday, you may speed it up.

### Building by your own

- `cargo install flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` install code generator

<!-- - `just run-no-cache` to run flutter locally -->

- `just codegen` generate code
- `flutter run` to run app

#### Packages that you probably need to download

- `clang`, `llvm-libs`, `glibc` - for building desktop app
- `multilib-devel` - 32 bit libs for android
- `android-studio` - to setup emulator and other android related stuff
  - see more info for android [here](https://cjycode.com/flutter_rust_bridge/integrate/android.html)

more info soon...
